My first serious project in C#.
This project lets you manage movies DB. There are two lists: movies that you already watched and you want to watch.
SQLite is being operated with the help of Entity Framework.
User interface is made with ASP.NET, Razor Pages and MVC Controllers.
Both tables give the user basic CRUD operations.
